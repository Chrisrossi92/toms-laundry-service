🧭 Tom’s Laundry — Version 2 Roadmap
🎯 Core Goals for V2

Mobile-first, app-ready design (easy path to React Native later).

Industrial quality emphasized (commercial machines, no in-home wash).

Minimal clicks to complete an order (conversion focus).

Scalable & modular so we can layer features without big rewrites.

✅ Phase 1: Foundation (Mobile-First Web App Enhancements)

Redesign Order Flow

Combine signup/login + first order into one smooth modal.

3 steps max:

Pickup/Delivery details

Preferences (optional, default to “Basic Wash & Fold”)

Payment/Confirm

Sticky “Place Order” button always visible on mobile.

Transparent Pricing Estimator

By weight + extras (bulky items, express delivery).

Show cost before checkout.

Clear messaging on minimum orders.

Scheduling Improvements

Customer selects time slot windows (2–3 hr blocks).

Recurring order toggle (“every week” / “every other week”).

🚀 Phase 2: Engagement & Trust

Order Tracking

Simple timeline: Placed → Picked Up → In Wash → Out for Delivery → Delivered.

Status auto-updates (basic backend triggers for now).

Notifications

Email + SMS updates at each stage.

Build hooks for future push notifications (for app version).

Trust & Transparency

“Commercial machines, no mixing” guarantee.

Facility photos + about us page.

Safety badges (staff background-checked, sanitized facility).

📈 Phase 3: Differentiators

Express Service Option

Same-day delivery for extra fee.

Clear upsell at checkout.

Loyalty & Referrals

Simple rewards system: credits for referrals & repeat orders.

Show credits on profile + apply at checkout.

Saved Preferences

Detergent type, folding style, delivery notes auto-fill.

Returning users = 1–2 taps to reorder.

📱 Phase 4: App Transition (React Native)

Wrap Current Codebase

Convert React components to React Native.

Reuse backend (Supabase + Stripe).

Publish PWA now → later App Store / Play Store.

App-Only Enhancements

Push notifications.

Driver ETA tracking.

B2B profiles (Airbnb, offices).
